# FakeNewsDetection_Project
This is a python code in which I have trained 2 different Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) over a dataset comprising of over 20,000 data points for classifying a news as true or false.

The file is in .ipynb format which is the python notebook format(Jupyter Notebook) and in the code section of the project the same code for .py format is also provided.
